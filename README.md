<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>10.1:</strong> (3.6 #11. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) <em>A</em> is an <em>m</em> by <em>n</em> matrix of rank <em>r</em>. Suppose there are right sides <strong>b</strong> for which <em>A</em><strong>x</strong> = <strong>b</strong> has <em>no</em> <em>solution</em>.

<ol>

 <li>What are all the inequalities (<em>&lt;</em> or â‰¤) that must be true between <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, and <em>r</em>?</li>

 <li>How do you know that <em>A<sup>T</sup></em><strong>y</strong> = <strong>0</strong> has solutions other than <strong>y</strong> = <strong>0</strong>?</li>

</ol>

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>10.2:</strong> (3.6 #24.) <em>A<sup>T</sup></em><strong>y</strong> = <strong>d</strong> is solvable when <strong>d</strong> is in which of the four subspaces? The solution <strong>y</strong> is unique when the  contains only the zero vector.
